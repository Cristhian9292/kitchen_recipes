# Coconut Rice

## Ingredients

- 2 coconuts
- 3 cups of rice
- 1 cup raisins
- 3 spoonfuls of sugar
- Salt to taste
- 7 cups of water including coconut water

# Steps to Make It

1. Remove the water through the holes in the coconut and store it separately. Then put the coconuts directly on the fire to split the shell easier. Once you have broken the coconut and with the help of a knife, remove the pulp and cut it into squares.
2. Blend all the pulp with coconut water and two cups of water, until it is as liquid as possible. Go through the strainer and preserve that milk.
3. Put the coconut milk in a cauldron and bring to the fire. Boil until the liquid is completely consumed and browned without burning.
4. With the other five cups of water, re-liquefy the pulp that you had reserved and strain it. Add this second mixture to the cauldron where the coconut melao is so that it is cooked with salt and sugar.
5. Add the previously washed rice. Taste salt, sugar and mix constantly to prevent sticking.
6. When it is dry, add the raisins and cover as tightly as possible. Reduce heat and finish cooking like a traditional white rice.
7. Enjoy!
