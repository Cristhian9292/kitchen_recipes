# Kibbeh

## Ingredients
* 2 pounds finely ground beef (or lamb, lean, divided)
* 1/2 pound bulghur cracked wheat (medium or #2)
* 1 teaspoon salt (plus 1/2 teaspoon)
* 1 teaspoon pepper (plus 1/2 teaspoon)
* 1 teaspoon allspice
* 1/4 teaspoon cumin
* 2 medium onions (1 finely chopped, and 1 coarsely chopped, divided)
* Optional: 1/2 cup toasted pine nuts
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* Vegetable oil (for frying)

# Steps to Make It

## Make Kibbeh Dough
* Gather the ingredients.
* In a medium bowl, soak wheat for 30 minutes in cold water.
* Remove and drain. Remove excess water by squeezing through thick paper towel or cheesecloth.
* Place into a medium bowl and combine with 1 pound meat, coarsely chopped onion, 1 teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon pepper.
* Combine well and place a small amount in a food processor until a dough-like consistency. You can slowly add an ice cube at a time during processing if needed.
* Place mixture aside, covered. Instead of using a food processor, you can use a mortar and pestle. However, it will take you over an hour to achieve the desired consistency.

## Prepare Kibbeh Stuffing
* In a medium frying pan, saut√© the finely chopped onion in olive oil. Add pine nuts if desired.
* Add ground lamb or beef and chop well with wooden spoon or spatula to ensure the meat is chopped. Add allspice, salt, pepper, and cumin.
* Once the beef is light brown, remove from heat. Allow it to cool for 10 minutes.

## Assemble Kibbeh and Fry
* Take an egg-sized amount of shell mixture and form into a ball. With your finger, poke a hole in the ball, making space for filling. Add filling and pinch the top to seal the ball. This recipe will make about 25 medium-sized kibbeh.
* You can then shape it into a point, or football shape, or leave as a ball.
* Fry in 350 F oil on stove top or in a deep fryer for about 10 minutes or until golden brown.
* Drain on paper towels and serve.
* Enjoy!
