# Perfect potato rösti

They're glorious plain, but a rösti can be made into a complete meal with the addition of onion, bacon and nutty Alpine cheese. 
(Some areas even add coffee; those crazy Swiss, eh?). All you really need for a good rösti, however, is some firm potatoes, 
parboiled to give a soft, melting interior, and fried in plenty of hot butter and goose fat until crisp, and a few mountains 
to climb to work up an appetite.

Serves 4 as a side dish, 2 as a main course

* 2 medium-sized waxy potatoes
* 1 tbsp butter
* 1 tbsp goose fat

1. Parboil the potatoes in salted water until just tender, but not soft. Allow to cool, and chill for at least a couple of hours.

2. Coarsely grate the potatoes and season. Heat half the fat in a small, heavy-based frying pan until sizzling, and then add the grated potato, allow to cook for a couple of minutes and then shape it into a flat cake, pressing down as lightly as possible. Allow to cook for a couple of minutes, then gently shake the pan to loosen the potato.

3. Continue to cook for about 10 minutes until golden and crisp, then place a plate on top of the pan and invert it so the cake sits, cooked-side up, on the plate.

4. Add the rest of the butter and goose fat to the pan and, when hot, slide the potato cake back into the pan the other way up. Cook for another 10 minutes, then serve.

Is a rösti nothing more than a hash brown with Alpine airs and graces, or a distinctive national dish Switzerland should be proud of? What are your top tips, and what other foods do you favour to keep off the mountain chill?
